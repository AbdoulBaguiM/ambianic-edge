# Project mission

Local data, custom AI models, federated learning

# Project Status
At this time, Ambianic is in active early formation stages. Lots of design and implementation decisions are made daily with focus on advancing the project to an initial stable version as soon as possible. 

If you are willing to take the risk that comes with early stage code and are able to dive deep into Python, Javascript, Gstreamer, and Tensorflow code, then please keep reading. Otherwise click on the Watch button above (Releases Only option) to be notified when we release a stable end user version.

# How to run in development mode
If you are interested to try the development version, follow these steps:
1. Clone this git repository.
2. `./ambianic-start.sh`
3. Study `config.yaml` and go from there.

# Contributors
