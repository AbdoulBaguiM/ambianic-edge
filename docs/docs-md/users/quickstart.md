Ambianic's main goal is to provide helpful inferences in the context of home
and business automation. Ambianic's main unit of work is the Ambianic pipeline.
The following diagram illustrates an example pipeline that takes as input a video stream
or an image URI source such as surveillance camera and
outputs object detections to a local directory.
